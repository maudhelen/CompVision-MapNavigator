# CompVision-MapNavigator
The purpose of the project is to build a program which will take some hand gestures to navigate in a computer. For the sake of the example we will use it to neviagte through Google Maps.

## Hand Gestures Guide

![Closed Palm](images/annotated_closed.jpg) Closed Palm will simulate a left mouse click, and hold it down as long as palm is closed

![Open Palm](images/annotated_open.jpg) Open Palm will not do anything, and will release all other commands going on (as a restarter almost)

![Point right](images/annotated_right.jpg)
![Point right alternative](images/annotated_right2.jpg) Pointing right will zoom in (simulating a mouse scrool downwards)

![Point left](images/annotated_left.jpg)
